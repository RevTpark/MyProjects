# Thesaurus Backend code
## Uses Postgresql database management.
It takes user input and searches the word in the json database.
It then validates the word and is also capable of finding closest matching word if there are typo's in the input.
It displays the multiple meanings of the word if it is valid.
***This version of the app uses postgresql to find the word and its meanings.***
